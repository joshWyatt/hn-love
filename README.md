hn-love
=======

hn-love will open that HN article you wanted to vote on when you get to a location where you are allowed to vote.

##Installation

    npm install -g hn-love


##Usage

    hn-love "Name of the Article You Want to Vote On"

When you run `hn-love`, it will quietly run in the terminal. When you are connected to the internet somewhere that you are allowed to vote, Chrome will open Google with a search query for the article you're interested in so you're one click away from upvoting. When you visit HN you will do so with a populated document.refferer value, so HN doesn't think you're a robot, which of course you are not.

Try connecting your computer to your mobile hotspot to test it out.
